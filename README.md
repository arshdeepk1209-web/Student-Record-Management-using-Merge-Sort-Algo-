# Student-Record-Management-using-Merge-Sort-Algo-
The project incorporates the Merge Sort algorithm for sorting records. Merge Sort is a stable, efficient, and comparison-based sorting algorithm based on the divide-and-conquer approach. It ensures that records with equal marks retain their relative order in the database, a property known as stability, which is essential in real-world record .
